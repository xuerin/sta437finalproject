## Not Just a traffic Jam
 "How do traffic anomalies manifest at location-specific versus network-wide scales, and what are the spatiotemporal propagation dynamics between these levels?"

You can also embed plots, for example:fgdhfkdjhdsfkhfsdhjhfsjfkdh

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
